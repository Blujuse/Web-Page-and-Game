# Sandcastle Smasher, Web Game Project!

## Description:

Sandcastle Smasher is a fast-paced, browser-based game that uses THREE.js for 3D rendering and ammo.js for realistic physics. Your mission is simple: smash as many sandcastles as possible before the timer runs out!
However, be cautiousâ€”your beach balls are limited, and running out will end the game. Use your ammunition wisely, time your shots, and aim for maximum destruction to rack up the highest score before time is up!
